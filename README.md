The benefits of the hybrid method are as follows:
   <ul>
     <li>Allows the user to tune the strength of the orthogonal projection and the shortest method</li>
     <li>Prevents overestimation effects by the orthogonal projection method when cracks are curved</li>
     <li>More distinct crack width measurements than the shortest method</li>
     <li>More robust to binary images that have unparallel boundaries</li>
   </ul>
   
How to use:
   <ol>
    <li>Input binary image</li>
    <li>Tune the pruning strength</li>
    <li>Tune the balancing coefficient</li>
   </ol>
